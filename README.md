* It consists of 3 folder namely
        1.dynamic --> This contains 18 files which is available on   dropdown menu of    the navbar in Homepage.
        

        2.img --> This folder contains images which is shown as a clickable links(a hyperlinks) on the Home page .

        3.profile --> This folder is for admin purpose . Is contains 36 file 
              (18 + 18) ==> 18 files for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete ) operation
              and 18 for the add new (in which admin can add a particular details)operation

             ````````````````````````` Naming Convention```````````````````````````````
             For example.  if a file name is  awards.php for CRUD operation
                            then for the add new operation file name will be
                            newAwards.php

*for connection to database
 you have to make a database name  first 
 and table for all the items which are in dynamic in nature (i.e. 18 tables + 1 for admin in which username and password will be there)

 Namely:-
          1. admin
                id    adminname   password
          2. awards
                id    awardname   Disc

          19. workshop
                id    organization    topic   startDate   endDate



                ** In the above scheme i have used status for stat (etc.) because that was a keyword used in SQL therefore, we can't use it .


  this is last before complition of this project ðŸ‘¨

    *During  hosting time  we get a  username and password of the database we have  to keep in mind what we have created.

    #As belowe you can see below example for localhost database and for production database only servername remains same and username password and database you have to change in all 18 files of  dynamic folder and (18+18) files of profile folder. i.e. totle 54 changes needed to run a project smoothly. 


 -------Example--------   
                // for localhost
                $servername = "localhost";
                $username = "root";
                $password = "";
                $database = "portfolio";


                // for production
                // $servername = "localhost";
                // $username = "id18903059_root";
                // $password = "DLIcutTda>1k8fju";
                // $database = "id18903059_poftfolio";


Thankyou.
